# Creet Infection

Creet Infection is a browser-based simulation game developed using OCaml, Eliom, and Js_of_ocaml. The game simulates the behavior of "Creet" entities that can be in various states such as healthy, sick, berserk, and mean. Players interact with the game through a client-server architecture, where the server manages the game logic and the client renders the game interface.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install OCaml**: Make sure you have the latest version of OCaml installed. You can use OPAM to manage your OCaml installation.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Use OPAM to install the required libraries:
   ```
   opam install eliom js_of_ocaml
   ```

3. **Build the Project**: Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```
   dune build
   ```

4. **Run the Server**: Start the server using:
   ```
   dune exec src/main.exe
   ```

5. **Access the Game**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to play the game.

## Gameplay Details

- **Creet States**: Creet entities can be in one of four states: healthy, sick, berserk, or mean. Each state has unique behaviors and interactions.
- **Movement**: Creeets move randomly within a defined rectangular area and bounce off the edges realistically.
- **Fixed Zones**: The game features a toxic river at the top (which makes healthy Creeets sick upon contact) and a hospital at the bottom (where manual movement can heal sick Creeets).
- **Reproduction**: As long as there is at least one healthy Creet, spontaneous reproduction occurs.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Players can drag and drop Creeets, making them invulnerable during the drag.
- **Contamination Mechanics**: Sick Creeets can contaminate healthy ones with a 2% chance upon contact, leading to various outcomes based on probabilities.

## Game Over Condition

The game ends when there are no healthy or living Creeets left, displaying a "GAME OVER" message.
